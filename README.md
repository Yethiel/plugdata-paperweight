Wave folder and low pass gate effect


## Parameters

**Fold**: Wave folding amount

**Gate**: Open or close the low pass gate (gate input, 1 or 0)

**GateFollow**: Amplitude opens low pass gate

**Bypass**: Dry signal

## Wave Folder

As wave folding increases, a low pass filter closes to filter out high frequencies that would distort the resulting folded wave.
The output signal is always clean and sqeaky without any harsh clipping.


## Low Pass Gate

A simple non-resonant filter with a natural decay when triggered. It can follow its input signal to act as a decompressor-like effect.
